Computer systems programming involves developing software to connect the
low-level computer hardware to high-level, user-facing application
software and usually requires careful consideration of performance and
resource constraints. Examples of computer systems software include
compilers, operating systems, databases, numerical libraries, and
embedded controllers. This course aims to provide a strong foundation in
the art, principles, and practices of computer systems programming using
C and C++, the languages of choice for system-level programmers.

The course lectures are structured into four parts. In the first part,
students will use C to explore procedural programming (e.g., functions,
conditional statements, iteration statements, recursion, types, pointers,
arrays, dynamic allocation). In the second part, students will apply
their knowledge of C to explore basic data structures and algorithms
(e.g., lists and vectors, complexity analysis, sorting algorithms,
abstract data types). In the third part, students will transition from C
to C++ and then use C++ to explore four programming paradigms:
object-oriented programming (e.g., C++ classes and inheritance for
dynamic polymorphism), generic programming (e.g., C++ templates for
static polymorphism), functional programming (e.g., C++ functors and
lambdas), and concurrent programming (e.g., C++ threads and atomics). In
the fourth part, students will apply their knowledge of multi-paradigm
C++ to explore more algorithms and data structures involving trees (e.g.,
binary search trees, binary heaps), tables (e.g., lookup tables, hash
tables), and graphs (e.g., depth-first search, breadth-first search,
shortest path, minimum spanning trees).

The course includes hands-on discussion sections and a series of five
programming assignments for students to put the principles they have
learned into practice. Students will gain experience with UNIX software
development including command line development tools, distributed version
control, unit testing frameworks, continuous integration, debugging
tools, and performance optimization. In the final two programming
assignments, students will work in pairs to design, implement, test, and
evaluate a high-performance handwriting recognition system to
automatically classify handwritten letters.
